# Augment-your-skills

Application simplifies knowledge sharing.
We are using the top modern technologies to provide great experience independently on the issue you are about to solve or distance to your mentor.

Common usage:
* You are facing a problem and need to ask someone for help.
* It does not matter if you know who to ask or not. Just put a request for help to the public board or ask specific user.
* Now, or at the agreed moment, use the app to make the connection between the both of you.
* The app installed in your cell phone or tablet streams the view to the mentor. 
  He or she can give you voice advice and draw navigating marks which immediately augments the camera view on your display.
* When the problem is solved you can reward the mentor. The both sides can write a short review and evaluate each other.
  
We are breaking the distances. 

Real example:<br/>
I need to help with the oil change in my car.
Why to spend extra money and waste time with arrangement of service.
Mentor can lead my hands and mark the important parts on the screen. 

Global benefits:<br/>
* You knew what you did with your car.
* You did not need to drive a car to the service, use another transport to go back etc.
* You saved fuel.
* You saved money.
* You have learned something new.
* Your mentor just sat in his living room and changed the oil with clean hands.
